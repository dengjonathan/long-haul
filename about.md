	<p class="intro">Hi! I'm Jon, a full stack software engineer specializing in building things for the web with JavaScript and Python. I bring grit, passion, and personal accountability to projects that address a meaningful need. Currently, I'm leveling up at <a href='http://www.hackreactor.com/'>@HackReactor</a> and contributing when I can to <a href='https://operationcode.org/'>@OperationCode</a>. Formerly <a href='https://twitter.com/USArmy'>@USArmy</a> and <a href='http://hls.harvard.edu/'>@HarvardLaw</a>.  I like React, Node, blogging, writing bash scripts, climbing, and doing long, wandery trail runs.</p>

	<p>While deployed with the U.S. Army, I worked in a division headquarters and my job involved writing the daily Situation Report, the summary of all major events and operations in progress for all of Iraq.  However, as I tried to incorporate data and metrics into my reports, I found that much of it was stored on idiosyncratic spreadsheets and rich text documents that I had to spent much of my time manually parsing. I had the good fortune of running into a contract software engineer on my base who convinced me that programming would be a good way to automate these tedious chores and a <span style="font-style: italic;">fun thing to do</span>. The rest is history.</p>
